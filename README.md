# Network Visualization Program

This is a program aiming at generating coordinates for a spatially balanced, ordered graph. It has preliminary plotting capabilities for these coordinates. This is made in response to the relative abundance of graph/network plotting libraries but the absence of a function to maintain ordered entities within these graphs or networks.
